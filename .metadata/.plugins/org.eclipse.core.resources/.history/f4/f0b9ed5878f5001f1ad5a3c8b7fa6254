Feature: Web Form Testing
  As a user
  I want to test various elements of a web form
  So that I can verify the form functionality

  Scenario: Testing web form elements and navigation
    Given I navigate to the web form page
    When I fill up the Text Input with "Sample Text"
    And I fill up the Password with "SecurePassword123"
    And I fill up the Text Area with "This is a sample text area content"
    And I click the "Return to index" link
    Then I verify the page title is "Index of Available Pages"
    When I navigate back to the web form page
    And I select "Two" from the dropdown
    Then I verify that the Checked Checkbox is selected
    And I verify that the Checked Radio Button is selected
    When I find the Default Checkbox using Relative Locator
    And I change the color in color picker to "#FF0000"
    And I set the date "2025-02-28" in the date picker
    And I click the Submit button
    Then I verify the message received is "Received!"
